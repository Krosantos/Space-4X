Hey!

So, (handsome future Tymko), if you're starting this from scratch on a new machine, do the following:

--Create a new Unity project
--Download this as a .zip/clone it/whatever.
--Drag the contents of the new Unity folder to this repo
--Stay golden

And seriously, you've tweaked the .gitignore enough. Now get off your ass.
