Hey!

So, (handsome future Tymko), if you're start this from scratch on a new machine, do the following:

--Create a new Unity project
--Download this as a .zip
--Drag the contents to the root project folder
--Stay golden

Seriously, I think I hit the .gitignore perfectly. Now go make this something real.
